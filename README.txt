This is a project I(Andreas Starrsjö) and Yuuki Jonsson did at KTH forour Bachelor degree 2011(http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DD143X/dkand11/) (Swedish)server.erl			The Server, it just listens for clientsclient.erl			The Client, it connects to the server, you need to configure the IP and PORT in here.db.erl				The Database, read and writes to mnesia db(where the clients are stored)bank.erl			Used by db.erl to create the db.(maybe you dont need it).bank.hrl			Used by db.erl to create the db.comple the files, erlc, and run them, erl, and start the server with: server:start().then start the client and just write the commands(balance(Who),deposit(Who,Val),withdraw(Who,Val)).You need to install the Erlang windows runtime first though.Any questions? Ask Google. Or maybe maybe me.
